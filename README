liblicense - 0.2

http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Liblicense

A library for managing license metadata.  It recognizes all Creative Commons licenses, Public Domain, GPL, and LGPL.

The library will produce licensing information based on the specifications of calling libraries and programs. In addition to generating text for specific licenses, it will also allow an application to enumerate which licenses are currently available and provide descriptive text for each license, and for license features. It should also provide an easy way to specify "verify at" URLs.

The benefit of this library is that applications linking to it can correctly offer licensing choices, and these choices can be transparently updated through package managers as license versions are updated. Human readable descriptions will also be internationalized, preferably using the same .po files used by the CC web site. Hence liblicense will take advantage of package updating and i18n systems to allow applications to always provide c current and correct licensing choices and license text.

Liblicense also features the capability to embed and extract license metadata from various file formats, including sidecar XMP.
