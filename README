liblicense - 0.4

http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Liblicense

A library for managing license metadata.  It recognizes all Creative
Commons licenses, Public Domain, GPL, and LGPL.

The library will produce licensing information based on the
specifications of calling libraries and programs.  In addition to
generating text for specific licenses, it will also allow an application
to enumerate which licenses are currently available and provide
descriptive text for each license, and for license features.  It should
also provide an easy way to specify "verify at" URLs.

The benefit of this library is that applications linking to it
can correctly offer licensing choices, and these choices can be
transparently updated through package managers as license versions are
updated.  Human readable descriptions will also be internationalized,
preferably using the same .po files used by the CC web site.  Hence
liblicense will take advantage of package updating and i18n systems to
allow applications to always provide current and correct licensing
choices and license text.

Liblicense also features the capability to embed and extract license
metadata from various file formats, including sidecar XMP.
