liblicense 0.7.0:

* Change LL_* constants into #defines to avoid problems with Python modules
* SONAME -> 2.0.0

liblicense 0.6.2:

* Fix /usr/bin/license so that it can read license information out of files
  (rather than assert(0)ing!).

liblicense 0.6.1:

* Finally fix SONAME to be 1
* Filter symbols by regex
* Remove spurious bad "FIXME" string in supposedly the license URI

liblicense 0.6:

* verification link support
* morePermission support
* Tests actually assert; all tests pass
* ensure all functions, etc are documented w/Doxygen

liblicense 0.5.1:

* fix Ruby bindings to compile - add stdbool.h include (hub)
* fix license_info.c's ll_parse_version to not free user-provided data (paulproteus)

Thanks to Hubert for a HUGE amount of work in this release:

* Adds fixes for various, many segfaults (all NULL dereferences, I think)
* Install licenses in a temporary directory
* Uses LL_ namespace for constants
* Add module_shutdown function for modules
* Detect valgrind, and use it for 'make check' if it is present
* Fix missing string.h include in modules/io/taglib.cpp
* Support building out of tree
* Install modules in an all-local Makefile target, and support clean-local
* Detect Python in configure.ac and refuse to build Python module if its headers are missing
* Automake cleanup: $(shell pwd) -> $(PWD)
* Do shared object name versioning: This ABI/API is v. 1.0.0
* Fix a memory leak in the tests
* Allow 'make check' to run uninstalled
* Fix compile warnings, including a crazy NO_WARN_UNUSED hack for the Ruby bindings
* Ask configure.ac to require Exempi 1.99.5 and adjust exempi.c and sidecar_xmp.c for the new Exempi API

From Nathan:

* The RDF generation that was a one-off hack for liblicense is cleaned-up and now part of our infrastructure; as a result, liblicense gets its RDF files from an svn:externals.
* In particular, the licenses have translated titles and no dc:type = License assertion.
* (The above includes cleanups to gen_licenses.py, including translationg the license title and treating the RDF as RDF never as raw XML.)

From Peter:

* Updates to .indent.pro with typenames we use
* Add extern string constants for ATTRIBUTION, COMMERCIAL_USE, etc.

From Scott:

* Change configure.ac to use msgfmt, not gmsgfmt, and add RPM .spec

From Jason, some of which is accepting patches by Peter:
* Fix license_chooser.c to not export non-ll_* symbols
* Prefix all types with ll_
* Hack around "unused argument" warnings in Python bindings, change magic zero padding at the end of the Python bindings
* Improve code style in license_chooser.c
* Typecast strlen return call to a SIGNED int to avoid a compile warning
* typecasts to (int) in license_info.c
* Comment out unused variables in licenses_cached.c that caused unused variable warnings
* Shortened variable names in modules/io/raptor.c
* Add a note about Vorbis prototypes needing const correctness analysis in mdoules/io/vorbis.c

From Asheesh:

* Fix null pointer dereferences in the case that libexempi failed to open a file we asked for metadata from
* Support LL_LICENSE_DIR environment variable as an alternate license storage path
* license_info.c: Redo the compile warning for license_info.c fix - use size_t as the storage field for the return from strlen
* license_info.c: Stop calling strlen() repeatedly, turning O(n^2) search into O(N) 
* license_info.c: Remove unsigned int warning fix because it truncates data; should be fixed in an API revision
